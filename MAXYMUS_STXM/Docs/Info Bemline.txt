What we know

high degree of coherence (open topic - important but not super urgend)
high flux
Focus size 2x2 mm (@ RZP) because of intermediate focus
Fast puls timing
high resolving Power (10.000 @ 1000 eV)
Energy range (200 - 2.500 eV)
eliptical spot is better to prevent the coherence in the hor. plane
45-50 Âµm FWHM ExitSlit horizontal
Stability important, huge impact of vibrations
Current Grating: 600 l/mm, blazed (specs unknown)
